## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Integrates with Weatherbit API to fetch and display 7-day weather forecasts
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Clean, intuitive interface displaying 10+ forecast entries with comprehensive weather details
- **Dynamic Search**: Real-time search functionality that filters results as you type
- **Smart Filtering**: Category-based filtering system for precise data exploration
- **Summary Analytics**: Three key statistical insights providing data overview at a glance

### Technical Highlights
- **Modern React Architecture**: Leverages React hooks (`useEffect`) and async/await patterns for optimal performance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring seamless experience across all devices
- **API Integration**: Robust error handling and data management for external API calls
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic content updates without page refresh

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **API**: Weatherbit Weather API
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design principles
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API with async/await

## üí° Key Implementation Details

### API Integration
```javascript
// Efficient async data fetching with error handling
const fetchWeatherData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINT);
    const data = await response.json();
    setWeatherData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Weather data fetch failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### Search & Filter Logic
- **Search**: Real-time filtering across multiple weather attributes
- **Category Filter**: Independent filtering system allowing users to narrow results by weather conditions
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced search to minimize API calls

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Summary Statistics
- Average temperature across forecast period
- Most common weather condition
- Temperature range analysis

### Interactive Elements
- **Search Bar**: Instantly filters forecast data across all visible attributes
- **Category Filter**: Filter by weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
- **Responsive Table**: Sortable columns with detailed weather metrics

## üéØ Development Insights

**Time Investment**: 13 hours of focused development
**Learning Outcomes**:
